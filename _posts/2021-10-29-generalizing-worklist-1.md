## Abstract

The worklist style inference algorithm is marvelous legacy left by no
other than the great Dr. Jimmy Zhao, which handles the problem of type inference
for a system with higher-ranked polymorphism efficiently and elegantly.
In this seminar we are going to explore what would happen when we attempt to
generalize the algorithm to a dependently-typed system. And see if the method
still holds its former glory.
