## Abstract

In this talk, I will talk about the type directed operational semantics gradual typing for object. Firstly, I will review our original work of typed directed operational semantics for gradual typing. Then a brief introduction about the work that we have added blame tracking to the typed directed operational semantics gradual typing. Importantly, we have incorporated the disjoint intersection types and single field record to get a typed directed operational semantics gradual typing calculus for object.
