## Abstract

Flow typing or occurrence typing specializes the type of an expression
in a type-case analysis. It has been implemented in some modern programming
languages including Ceylon, Typescript, Flow and Racket etc.
Flow typing has various practical applications such as safe type-casting
and detecting null deference at compile time.
In this talk we will talk about flow-typing and if it could be extended
to deal with equivalent variables or expressions.
