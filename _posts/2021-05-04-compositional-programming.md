## Abstract

In the recently accepted TOPLAS paper, we proposed a new statically typed modular programming style called *compositional programming*. It offers an alternative way to model data structures that differs from algebraic datatypes in functional programming and conventional OOP class hierarchies, and allows us to naturally solve challenges such as the expression problem, model attribute-grammar-like programs, and generally deal with modular programs with complex dependencies.

You may have heard an old talk last year or skimmed through the pretty long paper of compositional programming, but it seems that many of you don't remember it now and newcomers are not so familiar with this topic. It's a good time to refresh your memory!
