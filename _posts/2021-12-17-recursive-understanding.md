In this talk, I will first go over Amadio and Cardelli's seminal work ``subtyping recursive types",
then discuss about the recent paper ``revisiting iso-recursive subtyping".
I will also compare Amber rules in different setting, and give a new explaination to iso-recursive Amber rules.
Finally, I will talk about our new algorithmic iso-recursive subtyping rules.
